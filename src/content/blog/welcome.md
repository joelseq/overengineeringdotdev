This is a blog where I plan to share projects that I work on to grow my skills as a software engineer. For these projects, I plan on using tools, technologies and languages that I don't usually get to work with. I will try to use things that are open source or at least source available.

## Motivation

As software engineers, we are usually encouraged to build pragmatic solutions. This generally is a good idea as it leads to more maintainable software. But this may not always yield the most exciting solution to work on from a technical perspective. We are often left wondering what innovative solutions we could have come up if we got to use the hottest new tech.

This blog is my attempt to scratch that itch and build **solutions in search of problems**.

## Goals

1. Grow my skills as a software engineer.

By learning new tools, technologies and languages. I have mostly been a front-end focused software engineer so far in my career so I would like to explore back-end/systems programming more.

2. Document my projects.

By sharing my projects here I hope that it will motivate me to work on more projects. I plan to share the resources I find useful and my learnings so that it may be useful to others in their own projects.

3. Become a better writer.

Writing is a very high leverage skill for software engineers and one that I am terrible at. I hope that this blog can help me develop a writing habit and make me a better writer in the process.
